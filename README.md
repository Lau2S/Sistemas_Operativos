## Description

This repository contains the files of an exercise for the Operating Systems class

The main objective of the exercise is to compare the performance of a program when using different ways of implementation: threads, processes and sequential.

## Results of the executions

| Execution | Sequential (s) | Thread (s) | Process (s) |
|-----------|----------------|------------|-------------|
| 1         |162.82550048828125|           |43.961246490478516 |
| 2         |165.39500522613525|           |44.149916648864746 |

| *Average* |163.81039         |           |43.974             |

The average is calculated with the remaining values by eliminating the longest and the shortest time
